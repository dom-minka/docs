# Minka Transfiya documentation

## Structure

The documentation is using the docs.json to create navigation and pages. The docs.json file is located in the root of the documentation.

We have structured the documentation using multilanguage and versioning.
es/v1.66.0 is the initial version.



### Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where docs.json is)

```
mintlify dev
```

### Publishing Changes

Install our Github App to auto propagate changes from your repo to your deployment. Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch. Find the link to install on your dashboard.

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `docs.json`
